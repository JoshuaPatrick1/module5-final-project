# Module 5 Final Project – Classes and Test Classes

This project implements multiple Java classes and corresponding test classes as part of the Module 5 Final Project.

## Features
- Minimum of three Java classes implemented based on UML design.
- Test classes verify functionality and maintain correctness as methods evolve.
- Code follows proper style conventions with comments and formatting.

## How to Run
1. Compile all `.java` files in the `src/` folder.
2. Run the test classes to verify functionality.
3. Update test classes whenever new methods are added.

## UML Diagram
See `UML_Diagram.png` for the most recent class relationships.
